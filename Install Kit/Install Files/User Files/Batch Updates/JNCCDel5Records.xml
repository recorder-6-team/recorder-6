<batchupdate menupath="System Supplied\Delete" title="Del5 Deletes down from a level" 

description="This report deletes observation records including all the observation structure below the selected level. 
It works as a quick update on the item selected when you have the observation hieracrchy open, or on a Survey identified by name (wild card - so take care).
Always close the Observation hierarchy on completion. It will delete whole Surveys, Survey Events, Samples, Taxon_Occurrences and Biotope_Occurrences.
